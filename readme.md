Monday!

 - Add placeholders to the new/edit forms         DONE
 - Add a variable (new/update) to the form action DONE
 - Add a "create new book" button to /            DONE    
 - Add mini-validations to the back end           DONE
 - Decide on DB errors vs validations             td
 - Tidy up the sending of validations to render   td
 - Add a conditional error div to the new page    td
 - Look up what the "save" function is...         DONE
 

 Here's an idea; parse the DB error messages (which I create, after all) and if they're not
 expected, throw a bigger error but if they are, just pass them back to the edit page
