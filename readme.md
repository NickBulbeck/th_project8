Wednesday!
  - Move the linkDiv to above the script tag
  - Add the classes from Unit 2:
  --  ul
  --  li
  --  pagelink div
  --  active
  - Work out why the event-listeners aren't being added

TEMP DELETE!
  - Also the are-you-sure html needs to be added as an include, so the ${id} is accessible

  - work out why     .background(style=`background-image: url('/static/images/${url}.jpg');`) is
    removing the scroll bars

 - Handle the pagination in the front end.
 - Do the quick search in the back end.
 - Have an 'onClick'-style event-listener which is set up via pug
 - Then have the functions themselves in static js files
 - In practice you'd only display search results, not the whole library.
 - All searching happens in the back end, therefore.
 - Need a wee div for results per page.
 - Also need a decent database - 50 books or so.
