Notes:
you can have app.use(cookieRoutes) with no '/route' as the first yin,
because it will go through there no matter what the route. 

ARE-YOU-SURE DIV:
 - .areYouSure: remove border
 - #erMaybeNot: change wording and limit the width, and add .homeColours
 - add a #deleteBookButton and, again, limit the width and add .deleteColours
 - #douglasAdamsButton: limit the width, and maybe muck about with maxQuordleplean() in updatePage.js



TEMP DELETE!
  - work out why...
  -  .background(style=`background-image: url('/static/images/${url}.jpg')`)
  - is removing the scroll bars
