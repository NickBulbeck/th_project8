Notes:
you can have app.use(cookieRoutes) with no '/route' as the first yin,
because it will go through there no matter what the route. 

FEATURES TO ADD
 - use a counter in all of the pages
 - add a "no results" hingmy
 - create a border and background class for the headings and other text
 - beef up the database with mair books
 - create a seed data file

NEXT STEP
 - open the counter.js file
 - update the images file so that each image is a nobject with a nimage and an alt
 - update the pug file and make it add an alt
 - go through all the places where layout is called from and use counter.
 - while I'm at it, do a files/read to remove the hard-coded 12 counter.js
 - and re-name it imageCounter

TEMP DELETE!
  - work out why     .background(style=`background-image: url('/static/images/${url}.jpg');`) is
    removing the scroll bars
